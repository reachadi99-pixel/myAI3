I’m building a front-end UI for an AI chatbot called MB-AI, an MBA-focused assistant for Indian B-schools. Please create a clean, modern single-page web UI (React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS preferred, but plain React + CSS is also fine) with the following behaviour and layout:

🔧 Context about the bot (important)

Name: MB-AI

Purpose: Help candidates evaluate Indian MBA / B-school options using:

A knowledge base (uploaded documents like placement reports)

Live web search (but this should be invisible to the user in the UI)

The backend is already built (similar to Vercel’s useChat / /api/chat pattern). You don’t need to implement the AI logic, just assume there is a sendMessage(text: string) function that returns streamed assistant messages.

🎨 Layout requirements

Build a layout similar to a modern chat app:

Full-height layout

Page fills the viewport.

Main structure:

Fixed header at the top

Scrollable chat area in the middle

Fixed input bar at the bottom

Header

Left: small logo/avatar (placeholder is fine) for MB-AI.

Center: text Chat with MB-AI.

Right: a “New” button that clears the conversation.

Chat area

Centered, max-width ~700–800px on large screens, full width on mobile.

Messages stacked vertically:

User messages: right-aligned bubbles.

Assistant messages: left-aligned bubbles.

On initial load (no prior messages), show a welcome message from MB-AI with this text (or a slightly formatted version):

Hi there! I'm MB-AI — India’s first MBA intelligence assistant.
I help you make smarter B-school decisions using verified placement data and live web-sourced stats — not rumours or outdated blogs.
Ask me about:
• Comparing B-schools
• Placements, fees, cutoffs, batch stats
• Recruiters, specialisations, ROI and more

Input bar

Sticks to the bottom.

Contains:

A single-line text input.

A Send button (icon-only or with text).

Hitting Enter sends the message (Shift+Enter should allow multi-line only if easy; otherwise just single-line is fine).

🤖 Behaviour & UX details

Analyzing indicator (thinking state)

When a message is sent and the bot is thinking/streaming:

Show a small row below the last message:

A spinner icon

Text: Analyzing your query with animated dots:

Analyzing your query

Analyzing your query.

Analyzing your query..

Analyzing your query...

The dots should loop every ~400–500ms while waiting for the response.

When the assistant response is complete, this indicator disappears.

No tool / web search UI

Do NOT show any messages like:

“Used tool”

“Searched the web”

“Calling webSearch…”

The UI should only show:

User messages

Assistant’s natural language replies

No sources by default

The assistant sometimes uses citations or sources internally, but:

By default, do not show any “Sources” section.

The user might later type something like “show sources” — that will come as a normal message and the assistant will reply with sources. You don’t need a special UI for this beyond rendering whatever text the assistant sends.

College comparison UI (optional placeholder)

The system supports a special flow when the user types things like:
compare IIM A and IIM B or compare XLRI vs IIM Indore.

For this UI, just keep it simple:

No need to implement an actual comparison form.

Just make sure the chat layout is flexible enough to later insert a custom React component in place of a normal assistant message (e.g., a comparison card or table).
